        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jollof rice is West Africa's ultimate battlefield dish—every country swears theirs is the “real” one.
            The recipe usually starts with blending tomatoes, red bell peppers, onions, and Scotch bonnets into a fiery base, 
            then frying that mixture down with oil, spices, and sometimes a stubborn amount of seasoning cubes until it's thick and smoky. 
            Long-grain parboiled rice is stirred in, coated with the sauce like it just joined a cult, 
            then simmered with broth until each grain soaks up the reddish glory.</p>
        <p>You throw in bay leaves, thyme, maybe a sneaky pinch of curry, and let the pot do its magic. 
            Done right, the rice is fluffy, vibrant, and slightly charred at the bottom—the “party rice” 
            crunch everyone fights over like it's treasure.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

                red pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce and rosemary. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, stir in water, and add chicken pieces. Simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in rice, carrots, and green beans, and season with nutmeg. Bring to a boil,
