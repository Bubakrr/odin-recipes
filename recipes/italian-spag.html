        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Italian spaghetti is refreshingly straightforward compared to the chaos you grew up calling “spag.” 
            You boil the pasta in salted water until it's al dente, meanwhile simmering a sauce of olive oil, garlic, 
            onions, and ripe tomatoes (or canned San Marzanos if you're feeling fancy) with a splash of wine and herbs like basil and oregano.</p>
        <p>Some versions add ground beef or pork for a meaty kick, but the soul is always the tomato sauce coating every strand. Once the pasta is drained, 
            you toss it straight into the sauce so it actually absorbs flavor instead of looking like plain noodles drowned in soup. 
            Finish with parmesan on top and, if you're true to form, a drizzle of olive oil that makes the whole thing taste like Italy is judging you—but approving just a little.</p>
